We would like general users of the ODP to be able to understand what each dataset is about, and also ensure that specialists have the information they need to fully use data. As a result, our goal is to use a two-tiered approach to reading levels for descriptive metadata. In all cases, avoid language only known to people who work for the City of Detroit. Keep in mind that most people visit the ODP to use data, not to read text. Text should help users achieve their data-centric goals. When relevant, audience level is indicated in guidance for individual metadata fields.\n\nGeneral audience: Aim for an 8th-grade reading level, which is a common standard for text written for a broad general audience. Guidelines for general audience text include:\n\nUse words the audience knows.\nShorter words are better than longer ones.\nWrite simple sentences.\nUse the active voice to clearly explain “who did what”. Sometimes it may be helpful to use the passive voice, especially when emphasizing a key term or concept.\n\nSpecialized audience: Aim for a 12th-grade reading level.\n\nUse a specialized or technical term when it is more accurate, precise, or locates an idea in a specialized context. Some users will scan text to find a target technical term.\nA dataset may have more than one specialized audience. Try to incorporate language that accommodates each specialized audience.\nKeep sentences as simple as possible. Specialized audiences also appreciate clarity. Remember, users may be scanning text or cross-referencing text and data."

Audience level: General.\n\n\nSummary\nText included in the Summary field is usually presented immediately after the dataset title. The Summary should explain the main topic of the dataset in one or two sentences. Aim to write a summary that is helpful on its own and when followed by the dataset Description. In a dataset’s “Full Details” page on the ODP, the Summary is followed by an empty line and then the Description. On the ODP Map View, the Summary, but not the Description, is displayed. Audience level: General.\n\n\nDescription\nThe Description, or abstract, of a dataset should explain what data is collected, how it is collected, why, and by whom. The description should provide context and enough detail to enable a user to understand why the dataset exists, what it is about, and how it might be used. The dataset description is featured in the “Full Details” page of the ODP, a dataset’s homepage in AGO, and is partially displayed in some search result listings in the ODP. Audience level: Specialized.\nStart the description with an overview of the dataset and the most important information. Follow up with details. The first sentences should differ from the dataset Summary. The two fields are sometimes displayed consecutively. When applicable, the description should address the items listed below.\n\nWho collected the data, such as the department or organization responsible.\nHow the data was collected, whether it involved surveys, sensors, administrative records, or other methods.\nWhy the data is collected, for example, whether it is collected to fulfill regulatory requirements, a research initiative, or to administer a specific program or initiative.\nDescribe the original intended uses of the data, including if it is intended to inform decision-making processes, support research, or enhance public transparency.\nOrdinances or regulations that govern data collection or use should be highlighted.\nIf the dataset involves respondents, provide information about who they are, such as the demographic or professional characteristics, and explain how respondents were identified or recruited for data collection purposes.\nSpecify any unique characteristics or limitations of the dataset users should be aware of.\n\nNote data quality issues such as data gaps, incomplete records, or other known issues that may affect data analysis or interpretation.\nIf anonymization or other data masking techniques have been applied for security or privacy reasons, note the type of technique, which fields were affected and how, and implications for data interpretation.\n\nFor geospatial datasets, the WGS84 (ESPG:4326) coordinate system is the default coordinate system for the ODP. Identify the coordinate system or projection if it differs from this standard.\n\n\n\nReferences and links to related items\nIn the ODP and AGO, we want to help people find resources that are closely related to a dataset. At this time, we are able to link to resources from the description. Please note and include links to the items listed below from the dataset description. In the future, these items may be displayed via their independent, specialized metadata fields.\n\nCurrent and Archived datasets. Corresponding current and archived datasets should reference and link to each other.\nOriginal publicly available dataset. If the dataset is a copy or subset of a dataset published elsewhere, include a link and reference to the original dataset.\nProgram webpage: If available, reference and link to the City of Detroit program or initiative that results in collection of the data.\nApplication or dashboard: If known, link to and reference ODP web applications and dashboards that use the dataset.\n\n\n\nPublishing Frequency\nWhether and when a dataset will be updated is communicated using the Publishing Frequency metadata field. Select a publishing frequency descriptor using the following guidelines:\n\nFor datasets that are regularly published or updated, indicate the time interval for updates. Common publishing frequencies are: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, or Annually. The update frequency of archived datasets that are consolidated by year should be “Annually”.\nIf a dataset has been finalized or is a one-time data release, select “Not Updated”.\nIf the update frequency is irregular or a dataset will be published on an as-needed basis, select “As Needed”, and note the circumstances that would lead to an update.\n\n\n\nCredits (Attribution)\nCredits (Attribution) is visible on the bottom of the AGO site page. This should contain the department that provides the dataset and any others that contribute to the dataset. Department names should be spelled out, followed by their acronym in parentheses. Indicate who contributed what to a dataset when more than one contributor is credited.\nExample: For the Parcels dataset, the Credits are:\n\nOffice of the Assessor. Zoning data provided by the Buildings, Safety Engineering, and Environmental Department (BSEED) Zoning Division."

Where available, we have adopted widely used and published standards to help ensure metadata can be used and shared across information systems used by the City and external systems and services such as Data.gov and Internet search engines.\nThere are four types of metadata records for open data sets: Catalog records, Data set records, Distribution records, and Data Dictionaries.\n\nCatalog records group together data set records and contain a high level technical description of the collection of data sets as a whole. Through ArcGIS Online (AGO), for example, there is a catalog record with an entry for each and every data set available through the Open Data Portal.\nData set records are used to describe each data set as a whole. They contain information such as title, keywords, a narrative description, and the spatial and temporal scope of data included in the data set. Data set records are nested in catalogs.\nDistribution records describe files and APIs through which the public can access and obtain copies of data sets. Data distribution records are nested inside data set records.\nData dictionaries describe individual data fields (i.e., columns or variables) that comprise a data set. Data dictionaries are linked to data set records.\n\nTypically, most of the metadata in catalog and distribution records are created programmatically by DSA staff and the systems we license or implement. Metadata in data set records and data dictionaries incorporate information from a broader set of sources. These records are individually curated and include departmental knowledge shared by data stewards and other departmental experts."

Column order affects table usability and interpretability. General guidelines include the following:\n\nThe unique identifier field should be the first (i.e., leftmost) field in the table.\nImportance: All else being equal, more important columns should be first (farther left).\nRelated fields should be grouped together and follow general use conventions. For example:\n\nLatitude and Longitude columns should be adjacent, with latitude preceding longitude.\nAddress elements associated with a location should be grouped together and ordered according to standard USPS practice.\nIf different levels of a category scheme are allocated to separate fields, these fields should be grouped together. Typically, a broader or more inclusive category should precede a narrower or more exclusive category. That is, categories should precede related subcategories.\nIf more than one entity is described by columns in a table, group columns by entity. For example, if both a physical and a mailing address is present, group components of the physical address together and group components of the mailing address together.\n\nChronological order: If a row presents steps in a process, arrange columns to reflect the chronology of that process.\nConsistency across datasets: If two datasets have similar contents and creation contexts, similarities and differences in column order can signal similarities and differences between datasets.  \nIndustry standards: Fields of a standards-based or standards-aligned dataset should typically be ordered according to the specification of that standard.\n\nSpecial types of datasets may have a conventional structure that differs from one or more of these guidelines. For example, the first column in a time series dataset is typically a date or datetime variable. In such cases, it is appropriate to follow the conventional structure for the type of dataset."

Field names are retained in dataset files downloaded from the ODP and AGO.\n\nUse snake_case for field names.\n\nSeparate words by underscores if there are multiple words.\nOnly lowercase alphanumeric characters and underscores are allowed.\n\nField names should start with a letter.\nField names should be short and meaningful.\nField names should contribute to overall dataset usability. For example, rather than repeating a given descriptive word in every observation (i.e., value) of an attribute, consider including that word in the column name and excluding it from the value entries.\n\nExample field name from ODI Pit Dataset\n\n\nTable 1: Example field name from ODI Pit Dataset\n\n\n\n\n(a) Revision of column name and value format needed\n\n\nsize\n\n\n\n\nMedium vault\n\n\nSmall vault\n\n\nSmall vault\n\n\nLarge vault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Preferred column name and value format\n\n\nvault_size\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nSmall\n\n\nSmall\n\n\nLarge"

    "text": "The City of Detroit creates metadata for datasets published to the Open Data Portal to help people discover, use and interpret data we produce and collect. Where available, we have adopted widely used and published standards to help ensure metadata can be used and shared across information systems used by the City and external systems and services such as Data.gov and Internet search engines. Metadata specified by this standard are divided into two sections that correspond to two related but distinct types of metadata records, Dataset records and Data Dictionaries. The Dataset metadata record contains metadata used to describe a dataset as a whole; and the Data Dictionary, which is used to describe the individual fields and field values within a dataset."

    "section": "Types of Metadata Records",
    "text": "Types of Metadata Records\nMetadata may be grouped into four levels of records that correspond with how datasets are curated and shared: Catalog records, Dataset records, Distribution records, and Data Dictionaries.\n\nCatalog records group together dataset records and contain a high-level technical description of the collection of datasets as a whole. Through ArcGIS Online (AGO), for example, there is a catalog record with an entry for each and every dataset available through the Open Data Portal.\n\n\n\nDataset records are used to describe each dataset as a whole. They contain information such as title, keywords, a narrative description, and the spatial and temporal scope of data included in the dataset. Dataset records are nested in catalogs.\n\n\n\nDistribution records describe files and APIs through which the public can access and obtain copies of datasets. Data distribution records are nested inside dataset records.\nData dictionaries describe individual data fields (i.e., columns or variables) that comprise a dataset. Data dictionaries are linked to dataset records.\n\nTypically, metadata in Catalog and Distribution records are created programmatically by DSA staff and the systems we license or implement. Metadata in Dataset records and Data dictionaries incorporate information from a broader set of sources. These records are individually curated and include departmental knowledge shared by data stewards and other departmental experts.\n\nSystems and Published Standards\nEsri ArcGIS products are essential to data workflows within the City, and it is essential that our metadata is compatible with these systems. Compatibility with these systems also enables us to ensure our metadata is available to our local audiences that rely on Esri systems to discover and access our data. Based on our goals to ensure our data – and metadata – can be discovered and used by broader, more disparate audiences, Data.gov, the U.S. Government’s open data portal has informed our metadata standards. According to these interests, two metadata standards developed and published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that are supported by Esri, and the data catalog application profile used by Data.gov form the basis for our Catalog, Dataset, and Distribution-level metadata records. These standards are:\n\nISO 19115: 2014, Geographic information – Metadata\nISO 19139, Geographic information — Metadata — XML schema implementation\nDCAT-US Schema v1.1 (Project Open Data Metadata Schema)\n\nCurrently, there are not formal, widely used published standards for data dictionaries. Data dictionary elements identified for the City of Detroit standards are informed by best practices and guidance materials produced by the open government data and cognate communities (e.g., Kononow, 2017; New York City Open Data, 2022; Open Science Foundation, 2022; SCOPE Metadata Group, 2014)."

This Metadata Standard specifies six additional metadata fields that may be needed to describe data fields more thoroughly. For more complete field descriptions, use the additional metadata fields when applicable and accommodated by the data dictionary systems and technologies used."
